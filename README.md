# Amazon Product Scraping

This project is a web scraper that extracts product data from Amazon given the name of the product. The scraper uses web scraping techniques to access and extract relevant information from the Amazon website. The extracted data includes details such as the description, price, rating, and review count. The data is then stored in a CSV file, for further analysis. 

This tool allows users to easily gather information on a specific product, which can be useful for price comparison, market research, or tracking changes in availability and pricing.
